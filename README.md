# Project Description
A web-based N-Queens Puzzle Solver using Django and Python.

# What is an N-Queens Puzzle?
The N-queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial mathematics and computer science. It's a puzzle that involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens should be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

# Objectives 
To evaluate the performance and optimize the algorithm.
