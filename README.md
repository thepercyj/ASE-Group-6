# Project Description
 # N-Queen Puzzle
-A group project of web-based N-Queens Puzzle Solver using Django and Python. 
-Design an algorithm for solving the N-Queens puzzle for any board size N.
-Provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to enter the value of N and see the solution.
-Implement the optimization techniques to improve the algorithm's efficiency.

 # Kanoodle Solver
-Build a solver for the Kanoodle puzzle, which requires you to fit 12 different pieces into a specified board arrangement.
-Create a user interface that enables users to arrange and visualize Kanoodle pieces on the board.
-To identify optimal solutions for diverse Kanoodle puzzle combinations, use AI approaches such as backtracking or evolutionary algorithms.

# What is an N-Queens Puzzle?
The N-queens puzzle is a classic problem in combinatorial mathematics and computer science, also known as chess puzzles in this context, entail arranging or picking items based on certain rules or limitations. Chess puzzles are concerned with the positioning and movement of the pieces of chess on a chessboard. The goal of the N-Queens puzzle is to arrange N chess queens on a NxN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal at the same time. The task is to identify all potential configurations that satisfy these constraints.

# What is a Kanoodle solver?
Kanoodle is placing a set of 11 pieces into a three-dimensional puzzle board. The pieces have different forms, and the goal is to arrange them so that they fit together. Pattern Matching Puzzles frequently need spatial reasoning, vision, and strategic thinking. Identifying and managing patterns in a spatial context is required to solve them. Arranging parts to match a precise pattern, building structures, or accomplishing objectives within a limited space can all be challenging.

# Objectives
Create a web-based intelligent puzzle solver application that can solve two classic puzzles: the N-Queens puzzle and the Kanoodle puzzle. The project's goal is to show how different problem-solving methodologies, algorithms, and artificial intelligence (AI) principles can be used to solve these difficult puzzles.
To evaluate the performance and optimize the algorithm.

 # Steps to run the project locally

Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode):

 # Step 1
Go to the official VSCode Website Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Run the installer and follow the installation prompts. Install PyCharm (Optional):

OR

If you also want to install PyCharm Community Version, go to the official PyCharm Website Download the installer for your operating system. Run the installer and follow the installation prompts.

 # Step 2
Download our project and Extract the Zip Source Folder : Locate the source folder you want to extract. Right-click on the folder and choose "Extract" or use a zip utility program to extract the contents. Open the Project Folder in VSCode:

 # Step 3
Install Python Packages from requirements.txt: Open a terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the project directory where requirements.txt is located. Run the following command to install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

 # Step 4
Launch VSCode. Click on "File" in the menu and select "Open Folder". Navigate to the location where you extracted the source folder, select it, and click "Open". Run the Django Server:

 # Step 5
Open a terminal within VSCode (click on "Terminal" in the menu, then "New Terminal"). Navigate to the project directory (where manage.py is located). Run the following command to start the Django server:
python manage.py runserver

The server should now be running, and you can access the application through a web browser. That's it!
